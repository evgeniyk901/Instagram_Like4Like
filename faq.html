        <strong class="title">How is Celebus different than other services?</strong>
        <p>Almost every other service uses fake profiles advertised as ‘real members’ - they’re actually bots that appear real to Instagram for the time being. Celebus is similar to #like4like, which means that real Instagram users just like you are engaging in your profile. However, our members automatically deliver likes within eight hours of each new post you upload.</p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
       <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">Is there a limit to the number if Instagram posts I can upload each day?</strong>
        <p>Celebus does not use bots at all, as a member, you contribute likes to other members and they do the same with you.  The biggest proof that Celebus doesn’t use bots is the fact that you are not a bot, at least, we don’t think you are. </p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
      <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">Is there a limit to the number if Instagram posts I can upload each day?</strong>
        <p>There is a limit to four posts per day to receive likes. You may go beyond this amount, but you will have to add this option to your account by speaking with a customer service representative.</p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
      <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">Does my account need to be set to public?</strong>
        <p>We need the account to be set to public in order for our system to detect your new post upload. If you want to keep you account private, you are welcome to set the account to public just before you upload the post and then back to private afterwards.</p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
        <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">Why do I need to request access for some memberships?</strong>
        <p>There are two reasons. First, we must balance the memberships since some receive more likes than others and we need to maintain balance. Second, we must manually review some memberships to ensure that the content is interesting and original so we do not abuse Instagram.</p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
      <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">I have been denied access for a membership upgrade, what can I do?</strong>
        <p>If we have denied your membership upgrade request, it could be because we have reached the quota for that level and do not have enough free accounts to support more. If this is the case, you will be placed on a waiting list in order of requests. If your profile is not accepted, we will provide the reason.</p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
       <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">How fast will I receive likes and followers after each post upload?</strong>
        <p>In most cases, likes are provided for each post within four hours of uploading, but can take up to three hours to start. The delivery depends on how many other members are posting at the same time.</p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
       <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">Will my account get banned or disabled?</strong>
        <p>Absolutely not, Celebus works the same way as normal Instagram usage, we simply automate and accelerate the usage to help our members grow. Therefore, you are not in violation of terms and conditions. </p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
      <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">Do you offer a money back guarantee?</strong>
        <p>Absolutely, we offer a full money back guarantee for up to thirty days after your order has been purchased. Just Email or call a member from our 24/7 global support team and we will immediately assist you with your order or issue you a full refund instantly.</p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
      <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">How often can I change my Instagram username?</strong>
        <p>You can change your username once every 48 hours.</p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
      <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">Are these followers and likes targeted to my profile?</strong>
        <p>The members on Celebus range quite a bit from dogs to models, photographers, and just about everything else. If you would like to request a specific demographic to engage with your profile, email us at, support@celebus.com</p>

      <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">How long has Celebus been around?</strong>
        <p>Celebus as a website is pretty new, we launched to the mainstream market in Spring of 2017, but the technology has been around for a long time. It was previously only available as a tool used by PR agencies that managed top Instagrammer accounts, but we only recently introduced a version for the mainstream instagram market.</p>
      </div><!-- / item -->
      <div class="item">
        <strong class="title">Will this make me famous?</strong>
        <p>Probably not, but having a more active profile and photos signals to other members that you’re someone worth following, like a restaurant having a line outside the door.  For more information about how to get famous on Instagram as a person or brand, visit our blog at, www.celebus.com/blog.</p>
